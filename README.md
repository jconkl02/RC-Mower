# RC-Mower
All software to design and build an RC LawnMower
Software requirements include:
1) power managemnet
2) orientation management
3) FPV viewing 

I am an average RasPi enthusist, but have never dabbled in Arduino even though I own 2-3 boards. I want to design and build a lawn mower that can be controlled either by RF or by BT.
